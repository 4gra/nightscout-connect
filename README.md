# nightscout-connect

Nightscout's methods for synchronizing with common diabetes cloud providers.
This module provides a single entry point to Nightscout for similar modules
and allows managing http library and injecting dependencies from a single
point.


## Work in progress

* Nightscout
  * [x] hello world
  * [x] better gap finding
  * [x] glucose
  * [ ] treatments, profiles, devicestatus
* [x] Dexcom
* [x] Glooko
  * [x] fetch data
  * [x] translate data (likely needs work)
* [x] LibreLinkUp (needs testing)
* [ ] Diasend
* [x] Medtronic
  * [x] hello world
  * [x] glucose
  * [ ] treatments, profiles, devicestatus
  * [ ] sync data to Nightscout
* [ ] Tidepool
* [ ] Tandem

## Lower priority
* Better UI integration, diagnostics, test connection, fix errors, manage plugin...
* Generate predictable pattern eg sine for test.
* run in capture mode to generate up to date test fixtures
* better sidecar support
* better cli support (pipe to/from anywhere: `* | nightscout-connect | * `,
  file, fixtures, csv, json, web services...

## Help wanted
* more vendors
* better design suggestions
* testing


## Brief Doc
* `ENABLE=connect` include the keyword `connect` in the `ENABLE` list.
* Environment variable prefix `CONNECT_`:
  * `CONNECT_SOURCE` - The name for the source of one of the supported inputs.  one of `nightscout`, `dexcomshare`, etc...

### Nightscout

> Work in progress

To sync from another Nightscout site, include `CONNECT_SOURCE_ENDPOINT` and
`CONNECT_SOURCE_API_SECRET`. 
* `CONNECT_SOURCE=nightscout`
* `CONNECT_SOURCE_ENDPOINT=<URL>`
* `CONNECT_SOURCE_API_SECRET=<OPTIONAL_API_SECRET>`

The `CONNECT_SOURCE_ENDPOINT` must be a fully qualified URL and may contain a
`?token=<subject>` query string to specify an accessToken.
The `CONNECT_SOURCE_API_SECRET`, if provided, will be used to create a token
called `nightscout-connect-reader`.  This information or the token provided in
the query will be used to read information from Nightscout and is optional if
the site is readable by default.

Select this driver by setting `CONNECT_SOURCE` equal to `nightscout`.



### Dexcom Share
To synchronize from Dexcom Share use the following variables.
* `CONNECT_SOURCE=dexcomshare`
* `CONNECT_SHARE_ACCOUNT_NAME=`
* `CONNECT_SHARE_PASSWORD=`

Optional, `CONNECT_SHARE_REGION` and `CONNECT_SHARE_SERVER` do the same thing, only specify one.
* `CONNECT_SHARE_REGION=`  `ous` or `us`. `us` is the default if nothing is
  provided.  Selecting `us` sets `CONNECT_SHARE_SERVER` to `share2.dexcom.com`.
  Selecting `ous` here sets `CONNECT_SHARE_SERVER` to `shareous2.dexcom.com`.
* `CONNECT_SHARE_SERVER=` set the server domain to use.


### Glooko

> Note: Experimental.

To synchronize from Glooko use the following variables.
* `CONNECT_SOURCE=glooko`
* `CONNECT_GLOOKO_EMAIL=`
* `CONNECT_GLOOKO_PASSWORD=`

By default, `CONNECT_GLOOKO_SERVER` is set to `api.glooko.com` because the
default value for `CONNECT_GLOOKO_ENV` is `default`.
* `CONNECT_GLOOKO_ENV` is the word `default` by defalt.  Other values are
  `development`, `production`, for `api.glooko.work`, and
  `externalapi.glooko.com`, respectively.
* `CONNECT_GLOOKO_SERVER` the hostname server to use - `api.glooko.com` by `default`.

If both, `CONNECT_GLOOKO_SERVER` and `CONNECT_GLOOKO_ENV` are set, only
`CONNECT_GLOOKO_SERVER` will be used.

### Libre Link Up
To synchronize from Libre Link Up use the following variables.
* `CONNECT_SOURCE=linkup`
* `CONNECT_LINK_UP_USERNAME=`
* `CONNECT_LINK_UP_PASSWORD=`

By default, `CONNECT_LINK_UP_SERVER` is set to `api-eu.libreview.io` because the
default value for `CONNECT_LINK_UP_REGION` is `EU`.
Other available values for `CONNECT_LINK_UP_REGION`:
  * `US`, `EU`, `DE`, `FR`, `JP`, `AP`, `AU`, `AE`

For folks connected to many patients, you can provide the patient ID by setting
the `CONNECT_LINK_UP_PATIENT_ID` variable.

### Minimed Carelink
> Note: Experimental, only glucose for patient role is supported in
> proof of concept work.

To synchronize from Medtronic Minimed Carelink, set the following
environment variables.
* `CONNECT_SOURCE=minimedcarelink`
* `CONNECT_CARELINK_USERNAME`
* `CONNECT_CARELINK_PASSWORD`
* `CONNECT_CARELINK_REGION` Either `eu` to set `CONNECT_CARELINK_SERVER` to `carelink.minimed.eu` or `us` to use `carelink.minimed.com`.

For folk using the new Many to Many feature, please provide the username
of the ~~patient to follow using `CONNECT_`~~


### `NEXT work in progress DRIVER`

## History

Initially there was `share2nightscout-bridge`, then
[`minimed-connect-to-nightscout`](https://github.com/nightscout/minimed-connect-to-nightscout).
The `request` library was deprecated in February, 2020, and Nightscout needs to
adapt by using currently maintained and supported dependencies.  The initial
goal is to help deprecate `share2nightscout-bridge` and use currently supported
dependencies.
Now there are more:
* https://github.com/burnedikt/diasend-nightscout-bridge
* https://github.com/jpollock/glooko2nightscout-bridge
* https://github.com/timoschlueter/nightscout-librelink-up
* https://github.com/jwoglom/tconnectsync
* https://github.com/skalahonza/TidepoolToNightScoutSync

This module should be sufficient to replace `share2nightscout-bridge` as an
initial minimum viable project.  There are a few minor enhancements to help
encourage migration away from `share2nightscout-bridge`:
* Less latency: new glucose fetches will be tightly aligned to the previous glucose reading.
  In most cases, new glucose readings will be produced within 30 seconds.
* Safe retries: There is an exponential backoff system to help prevent locking
  your account if the password changes.  Each retry will take a much longer
  amount of time.
* Safe community: There are now randomization behaviors to prevent tragedy of
  the commons from occurring.  These features help spread the load to avoid
  accidentally overwhelming vendor servers.
